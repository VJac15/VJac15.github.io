        <p>Hi! My name is Varsha Jacob, and I'm a 2nd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My specializations are networking, including information security and database management, and AI/ML.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love going hiking with my family, spending time with my dog Max, and finding new bands on Spotify!</p>
        <p>Fun fact: The image in my header is one I took at Mount Mitchell State Park near Asheville, NC. Mount Mitchell is the highest point in the U.S. east of the Mississippi River, and I had a fun time hiking it this fall!</p>

    <h3>TIAA</h3>
    <h4>Software Engineering Intern - Cybersecurity</h4>
    <p>This past summer (2023), I was part of the TIAA Intern Program at Charlotte, NC in the cybersecurity department. 
    I had the opportunity to learn a lot at my first corporate professional experience, and I also got to network with some really cool people, including both my fellow interns and TIAA full-time associates.
    During my internship, I was able to work with my manager, team, and mentors to contribute to an application used by TIAA. I also got to participate in daily stand-ups, code reviews, and peer programming. </p>
    <h3>Georgia Tech College of Computing</h3>
    <h4>Teaching Assistant - CS 1331</h4>
    <p>I am a teaching assistant at GT for CS 1331 (Intro to Object Oriented Programming). As a teaching assistant, I work with the instructor and teaching assistant team and help create assignments and grade papers.
        I also hold office hours at least twice weekly to answer student questions, clarify topics, or to help debug. 
    </p>

    <h3>TIAA Internship Hackathon - Marketing Suite</h3>
    <h4>1st Place</h4>
    <p>As a technology intern at TIAA, I was tasked with creating a tool that would bring retirement education to my peers, Gen Z. 
        I was challenged to use Generative AI to create a personalized educational retirement-planning solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Datapath and Interrupts</h3>
    <h4>CS 2200</h4>
    <p>As part of my CS 2200 (Intro to Computer Systems and Networks) class, I got to create an entire computer from scratch using CircuitSim, which (as its name suggests), simulates circuits.
    This project was actually composed of two smaller projects. First, I created a working datapath by stringing together registers, wires, arithmetic operators, and more to create a working computer. 
    For the next phase of the project, I implemented hardware and handlers that would allow for interrupts without losing the state of the original program.
