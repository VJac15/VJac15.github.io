    <h3>Datapath and Interrupts</h3>
    <h4>CS 2200</h4>
    <p>As part of my CS 2200 (Intro to Computer Systems and Networks) class, I got to create an entire computer from scratch using CircuitSim, which (as its name suggests), simulates circuits.
    This project was actually composed of two smaller projects. First, I created a working datapath by stringing together registers, wires, arithmetic operators, and more to create a working computer. 
    For the next phase of the project, I implemented hardware and handlers that would allow for interrupts without losing the state of the original program.
