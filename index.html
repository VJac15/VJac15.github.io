        <p>Hi! My name is Varsha Jacob, and I'm a 2nd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My specializations are networking, including information security and database management, and AI/ML.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love going hiking with my family, spending time with my dog Max, and finding new bands on Spotify! I'm also super passionate about music! 
          I have been playing the violin for 9 years, and I picked up the lyre harp a few years ago during Covid. 
        </p>
        <p>Fun fact: The image in my header is one I took at Mount Mitchell State Park near Asheville, NC. Mount Mitchell is the highest point in the U.S. east of the Mississippi River, and I had a fun time hiking it this fall!</p>

    <h3>TIAA</h3>
    <h4>Software Engineering Intern - Cybersecurity</h4>
    <p>This past summer (2023), I was part of the TIAA Intern Program at Charlotte, NC in the cybersecurity department. 
    I had the opportunity to learn a lot at my first corporate professional experience, and I also got to network with some really cool people, including both my fellow interns and TIAA full-time associates.
    During my internship, I was able to work with my manager, team, and mentors to contribute to an application used by TIAA. I also got to participate in daily stand-ups, code reviews, and peer programming. </p>
    <h3>Georgia Tech College of Computing</h3>
    <h4>Teaching Assistant - CS 1331</h4>
    <p>I am a teaching assistant at GT for CS 1331 (Intro to Object Oriented Programming). As a teaching assistant, I work with the instructor and teaching assistant team and help create assignments and grade papers.
        I also hold office hours at least twice weekly to answer student questions, clarify topics, or to help debug.
